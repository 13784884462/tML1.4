//Things that need to be done after initial patches are fixed.
//This can include new systems that should be accounted for


//Rartrin
	//Wing
		//Loading should leverage player.GetWingStats()
		//ArmorIDs.Wing.Sets.Stats
	//Background system
		//Main.bgAlpha2 became Main.bgAlphaFrontLayer
		//Background system in general got some refactoring
	//Minimum zoom comparer
		//Check if ModLoader.ModLoader.removeForcedMinimumZoom is still needed now that MinimumZoomComparerX and Y exist
	//WaterStyleLoader.ChooseWaterStyle
		//Vanilla has Main.CalculateWaterStyle() now
	//Integrate with vanilla asset system
		//?Reimplement PlayerHooks.GetMapBackgroundImage in DrawMapFullscreenBackground so it can use assets
